\chapter{Sandhi}

In the book on sandhi (joining words), there are 51 suttas totally. Mostly, it is about methodology of combining two words into one unit. There is also a preliminary part on Pāli alphabet.

The first section is general introduction. Sutta 1--9 are about Pāli letters and their terminology. Sutta 10--11 talk about conceptual ideas of sandhi methodology.

The second section, Sutta 10--22, is on sandhi methods, mainly concerning vowels, elision and substitution.

The third section, Sutta 23--29, continues on sandhi methods, mainly concerning consonants, retaining the original form, some transformations, and reduplication.

The fourth section, Sutta 30--41, continues on sandhi methods mainly concerning niggahita.

The fifth section, Sutta 42--51, continues on sandhi methods, mostly about substitutions.

\section{Paṭhamakaṇḍa}

\head{1}{1, 1. attho akkharasaññāto.}
\headtrans{Meaning [is] known by the letters.}
\sutdef{sabbavacanānamattho akkhareheva saññāyate. akkharavipattiyaṃ hi atthassa dunnayathā hoti, tasmā akkharakosallaṃ bahūpakāraṃ suttantesu.}
\sutdeftrans{The meaning of all the teachings is known only by the letters. Because of corruption of the letters, there is such difficulty of interpretation of the meaning. Therefore, [being] one having competence in the letters [is] very helpful in [the reading of] Suttas.}
\transnote{As implied by \pali{suttantesu}, \pali{vacana} here means the teaching.}

\head{2}{2, 2. akkharāpādayo ekacattālīsaṃ.}
\headtrans{The letters [are] those forty-one, such as \pali{a} and so on.}
\sutdef{te ca kho akkharā api akārādayo ekacattālīsa suttantesu sopa\-kārā.}
\sutdeftrans{These 41 letters, such as \pali{a} and so on, [are] helpful in [the reading of] Suttas.}
\transnote{\pali{Akkharāpādayo} can be cut as \pali{akkharā + pi + a + ādayo}. In the definition, \pali{sopakārā} is \pali{sa + upakārā} (see Kacc 14 below). Most particles in this sentence have little meaning, so left out. To be complete, the 41 letters are listed as follows: \pali{a ā i ī u ū e o, ka kha ga gha ṅa, ca cha ja jha ña, ṭa ṭha ḍa ḍha ṇa, ta tha da dha na, pa pha ba bha ma, ya ra la va sa ha ḷa aṃ}.}

\head{3}{3, 3. tatthodantā sarā aṭṭha.}
\headtrans{In those [forty-one], eight, ending by \pali{o}, [are] `\pali{sara}.'}
\sutdef{tattha akkharesu akārādīsu odantā aṭṭha akkharā sarā nāma honti.}
\sutdeftrans{In those letters, eight letters such as \pali{a} and so on to \pali{o} at the end are called `\pali{sara}' (vowels).}

\head{4}{4, 4. lahumattā tayo rassā.}
\headtrans{Three [vowels in those eight] with short-meter [are] `\pali{rassa}.'}
\sutdef{tattha aṭṭhasu saresu lahumattā tayo sarā rassā nāma honti.}
\sutdeftrans{In those eight vowels, three vowels with short-meter are called `\pali{rassa}' (short).}
\transnote{The short three vowels are \pali{a, i, u}.}

\head{5}{5, 5. aññe dīghā.}
\headtrans{The other [vowels are] `\pali{dīgha}.'}
\sutdef{tattha aṭṭhasu saresu rassehi aññe pañca sarā dīghā nāma honti.}
\sutdeftrans{In those eight vowels, five vowels other than the short are called `\pali{dīgha}' (long).}
\transnote{The long five vowels are \pali{ā, ī, ū, e, o}.}

\head{6}{6, 8. sesā byañjanā.}
\headtrans{The rest [are] `\pali{byañjana}.'}
\sutdef{ṭhapetvā aṭṭha sare sesā akkharā kakārādayo niggahitantā byañjanā nāma honti.}
\sutdeftrans{Except the eight vowels, the remaining letters, such as \pali{ka} and so on to \pali{niggahita} at the end are called `\pali{byañjana}' (consonants)}

\head{7}{7, 9. vaggā pañcapañcaso mantā.}
\headtrans{[Those] by \pali{ma} at the end, [grouped] by five each, [are] `\pali{vagga}.'}
\sutdef{tesaṃ kho byañjanānaṃ kakārādayo makārantā pañcapañcaso akkharavanto vaggā nāma honti.}
\sutdeftrans{Of these consonants, such as \pali{ka} and so on to \pali{ma} at the end, those having letters grouped by five each are called `\pali{vagga}' (group).}
\transnote{There are five groups by this arrangement, i.e., \pali{ka kha ga gha ṅa, ca cha ja jha ña, ṭa ṭha ḍa ḍha ṇa, ta tha da dha na, pa pha ba bha ma}.}

\head{8}{8, 10. aṃ iti niggahitaṃ.}
\headtrans{The letter \pali{aṃ} [is] `\pali{niggahita}.'}
\sutdef{aṃ iti niggahitaṃ nāma hoti.}
\sutdeftrans{The letter \pali{aṃ} is called `\pali{niggahita}.'}

\head{9}{9, 11. parasamaññā payoge.}
\headtrans{[When] others' grammatical terms [are] in use.}
\sutdef{yā ca pana paresu sakkataganthesu samaññā ghosāti vā agho\-sāti vā, tā payoge sati etthāpi yujjante.}
\sutdeftrans{When which grammatical terms, such as \pali{ghosa} or \pali{aghosa}, [are used] in other Sanskrit texts; that [terms], when applicable, are also used here.}
\transnote{This sutta is difficult to translate cleanly. In its definition, there is an absolute construction or a relative clause with locative case (\pali{sati} is a locative form of \pali{santa}). The \pali{ya-ta} structure also makes the sentence complicated, but understandable nonetheless.}

\head{10}{10, 12. pubbamadhoṭhitamassaraṃ sarena viyojaye.}
\headtrans{[One should] separate [the term] by vowel, making the preceding consonant stand below, vowel-free.}
\sutdef{tattha sandhiṃ kattukāmo pubbabyañjanaṃ adhoṭhitaṃ assaraṃ katvā sarañca upari katvā sarena viyojaye}
\sutdeftrans{There, one who want to do a sandhi should separate the preceding consonant by vowel to make it stand below; making it vowel-free and putting the vowel above.}
\transnote{\pali{Pubbamadhoṭhitamassaraṃ} can be cut as \pali{pubbaṃ + a\-dhoṭhitaṃ + assaraṃ}. The last part means vowel-free. This sutta is an operation before a sandhi is made. It is really abstract, so do not take `above' and `below' literally. This idea is in fact simple: just know the vowel so you can separate it properly (or drop it when needed).}

\head{11}{11, 14. naye paraṃ yutte.}
\headtrans{[One] should put [the above-mentioned vowel-free consonant] to the other [letter] in a proper place.}
\sutdef{assaraṃ kho byañjanaṃ adhoṭhataṃ parakkharaṃ naye yutte.}
\sutdeftrans{[One] should put the vowel-free consonant stood below to the other letter in a proper place.}
\example{tatrābhiratimiccheyya = tatra + abhiratiṃ + iccheyya}
\transnote{By the method explained above, when \pali{tatra} is put into a sandhi, make it vowel-free first, hence \pali{tatr}. Then connect it to another term properly using other rules explained below.}
